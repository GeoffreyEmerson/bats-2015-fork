This is the README file for BATS (Basic Asset Tracking System) created by Geoffrey Emerson.

BATS uses PHP and a PostgreSQL database to make tracking company assets easy and efficient. The work flow is designed from the ground up with the user in mind to make moves, adds, and decomissioning as easy as possible, so that there is no reason to allow your digital asset tracking to fall behind your real world deployment state.

When the project is fully transferred to github, I will be adding a guide to set up the Postgres database and customize the PHP scripts to work for your setup.
